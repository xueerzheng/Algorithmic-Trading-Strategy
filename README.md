# Algorithmic-Trading-Strategy

In this study, three algorithmic trading strategies (the autoregressive model, the meanreversion strategy, and the trend-following strategy) were involved to compare their profitability.
Specifically, the given equation was used to generate a stock price time series from time 0 to 2000. Based on this time series, I defined three long-term strategies and calculated their log returns. By comparing their Sharpe ratio, value at risk (VaR) and MaximumDrawdown, and conducting hypothesis testing, I finally concluded that the trendfollowingstrategy had the best performance, and it was indeed profitable.
